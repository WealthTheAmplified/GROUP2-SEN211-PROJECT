                        <P>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving a specific goal. It is
                            a set of instructions that is finite, definite, and effective. Algorithms can be expressed in various
                            forms, such as natural language, flowcharts, pseudocode, or programming languages.

 Input: An algorithm receives input data.
 Processing: An algorithm performs operations on the input data.
 Output: An algorithm produces output data.
 Finiteness: An algorithm has a finite number of steps.
 Definiteness: An algorithm has well-defined steps.
 Effectiveness: An algorithm produces the desired output.
A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. It uses symbols, arrows, and text to
illustrate the steps and logic of a program. Flowcharts are useful for visualizing, designing, and
communicating the flow of a program.
Types of Flowchart Symbols:
- Oval: Start/Stop
- Rectangle: Process
- Diamond: Decision
- Arrow: Flow of control
- Parallelogram: Input/Output
Advantages of Flowcharts:
- Helps to break down complex problems into manageable parts.
- Ensures clarity and precision in programming.
- Facilitates communication and collaboration among programmers.
- Enhances problem-solving skills and logical thinking.
Disadvantages of Flowcharts:
- Can be time-consuming to create.
- May not be suitable for large and complex progra
