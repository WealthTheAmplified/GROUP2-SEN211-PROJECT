            <h3 class="lectures-overview-header">Keywords, Variables and Assignment Statements</h3>
            <P>Keywords are reserved words in a programming lauguage that have special meanings. <br>They cannot be used as variable names. Examples of keywords include if, else, while,<br> for, int, and double. Keywords are used to define the structure and syntax of a program. <br>Variable are names given to memory locations to store data. A variable has a data type, <br>which determines the type of data that can be stored in it. Variables can be assigned a <br>new value. There are several type of variables, including integer variables, floating-point <br>variables, and character variables.<br><br>

            <h3>Types of Variables:</h3>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Integer variables are used to store whole numbers. They are declared using the int keyword. <br>Example: int x = 5;</li> 
                    <li>Floating-point variables are used to store decimal numbers. They are declared using the <br>double keyword. Example double y = 3.14</li>
                    <li>Character variables are used to store single characters. They are declared using the character <br>keyword. Example: character z = &#39;A&#39;;</li> 
                </ul><br>

            <h3>Assignment Statement</h3> 
            <p>Assignment statements are used to assign a value to a variable. The syntax for an assignment <br>statement is a variable_name = value;. For example: x = 5; assigns the value 5 to the variable x.</p>
<br>
            <h3>Rules of Naming Variables:</h3>
            <p>Variable names must start with a letter or underscore. They can contain letters, digits and underscore. <br>Variable names cannot contain special characters or keywords. Variable names must be unique within <br>the program. Examples of valid variable names include x, y, z, and total marks. Examples of invalid <br>variable names include 123, if total-marks.</p>
