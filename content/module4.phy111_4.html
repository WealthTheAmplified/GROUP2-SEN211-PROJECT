    <h1>Part 4: Waves, Electricity, and Modern Physics</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 22: Wave Motion</h2>
    <p>This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of wave motion. It begins by defining a <u>propagating wave</u>
        as a self-sustaining disturbance in a medium that travels from one point to another, carrying energy and
        momentum. The key distinction is made between <em>transverse waves</em> (like those on a string, where particle
        vibration is perpendicular to propagation direction) and <em>longitudinal waves</em> (like sound, where particle
        vibration is parallel to propagation). </p>

    <p>Important terminology is defined, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wavelength (λ):</strong> The distance between corresponding points on successive waves.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency (f):</strong> The number of cycles per second (Hz).</li>

        <li><strong>Speed (v):</strong> The speed of wave propagation (v = fλ).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The chapter then delves into <em>standing waves</em>, which occur when a system resonates efficiently at certain
        vibrational frequencies. Nodes and antinodes are explained, as is the condition for resonance. Finally, the
